# Dragnet

Self-hosted, multi-tenant code review platform. The Greptile-tier review quality (full-codebase indexing + agentic review loop) without pushing source code to a third-party SaaS.

**Status:** MVP in progress. See [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for current priorities and [`prd.md`](./prd.md) for the full product spec.

---

## What it does

- Watches one or more local git repositories
- Indexes the whole codebase (tree-sitter → call graph → summaries → vector embeddings)
  - **v1:** TypeScript / JavaScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`) via `tree-sitter-typescript`. Other languages are walked but contribute zero symbols until their grammar spec lands — honest partial indexing, not a regex fallback. Adding Python/Go/Ruby/etc. is a small additive spec per language (pattern proven by the TS/JS spec).
- On PR scan, retrieves codebase context beyond the diff and runs an LLM-driven agentic review
- Produces structured findings backed by evidence chains (every finding cites real code)
- Runs entirely inside your infrastructure — source code never leaves your network

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack, Route Handlers)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.8, React 19
- **Database:** Postgres (Supabase by default) via Prisma 7.8 + `@prisma/adapter-pg`
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **AI:** OpenAI-compatible endpoints (OpenRouter by default) via `openai` SDK — works with OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, and any other OpenAI-compatible server
- **Auth:** Better Auth (planned — Phase 2)

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, a Postgres database (Supabase or local).

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in real values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. Configure LLM providers at runtime from the **LLM Settings** tab (writes to `.dragnet/llm-presets.json`, mode 0600; changes take effect on the next request — no restart). A primary and optional fallback provider can be configured for each of chat and embedding; if both fail, the review returns empty findings with an actionable banner (never fabricated output).

3. **Generate the Prisma client and push the schema:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Run the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3300.

The in-app **DB Config** tab lets you re-test and re-save the database connection without editing `.env.local` by hand. The **LLM Settings** tab lets you point Dragnet at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio), browse the live model catalog, and configure a **primary + optional fallback** provider for each role (chat + embedding). When the primary fails, the fallback is tried automatically — if both fail, reviews return empty findings + null rating with an actionable banner, and embeddings trip a session circuit breaker to avoid log spam.

## Before contributing

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — it covers the non-obvious conventions: Prisma singleton pattern, Next 16 Promise-based params, the pg 8.21 SSL workaround, and the 500-line file-size rule.

**What never gets committed:**
- `.env.local` and any `.env*` except `.env.example` (placeholders only)
- `src/generated/prisma/` (Prisma client output)
- `.next/` (build artifacts)

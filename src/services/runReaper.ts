/**
 * Stale-run reaper.
 *
 * Why this exists: when the dev serverless instance / Next worker / dev
 * laptop is killed mid-scan (ctrl-c, crash, OOM, deploy eviction), the
 * in-memory review lock evaporates but the `ReviewRun` row stays
 * `in_progress` forever. Future scans on that PR trip the
 * `assertNoActiveScan` guard and 409 — the PR is bricked until someone
 * manually updates the DB or passes `?force=true`.
 *
 * Two layers of defense:
 *
 *   1. `src/lib/reviewFreshness.ts:assertNoActiveScan` reaps on-demand
 *      when a new scan would trip on an orphan. Lazy — runs only when
 *      the PR is hit again.
 *
 *   2. This function (Layer 3): eager sweep at boot. Catches orphans
 *      before the first request even hits the guard, so a freshly
 *      restarted server presents a clean state to the operator.
 *
 * Idempotent: safe to call multiple times. `updateMany` is a single
 * atomic SQL UPDATE; concurrent reapers (rare — only happens if boot
 * overlaps with a Layer 2 reap) won't double-count.
 *
 * Failure mode: never throws. DB unavailable at boot → log + move on.
 * The scan guard (Layer 2) will retry on the next request.

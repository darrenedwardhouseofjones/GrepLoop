/**
 * Resolves GrepLoop's externally-reachable URL and whether it's a
 * localhost-only address. Drives the WebhookPrompt branch: when
 * `isLocal === true`, the prompt shows Cloudflare Tunnel setup steps
 * first (GitHub/GitLab can't deliver webhooks to localhost); when
 * false, it skips straight to webhook creation.
 *
 * The URL is sourced from `DRAGNET_PUBLIC_URL` (set this to a tunnel
 * URL or a VPS public URL). Defaults to `http://localhost:3300`
 * (matches the dev server port in package.json).

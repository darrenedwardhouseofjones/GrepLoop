/**
 * Shared in-progress review tracker. Maps prId → start timestamp.
 *
 * Hoisted out of the command route so the in-app scan route
 * (`/api/prs/[prId]/scan`) shares the SAME lock — otherwise two concurrent
 * scans of one PR race `reviewFinding.deleteMany`→`createMany`,
 * double-increment `reviewsCount`, and write duplicate `reviewHistory`.
 * Both routes run in the same Node process, so this module singleton is
 * shared between them.
 *
 * Why TTL: a review that hangs (network partition, LLM stall, an unhandled
 * rejection that bypasses .catch) would otherwise sit in the Map forever,
 * blocking re-reviews. Entries older than REVIEW_TTL_MS are evicted on read
 * and the caller can re-queue.
 *
 * Restart note: in-memory only. A server crash mid-review loses the entry —
 * the PR simply appears "not in progress" and the caller can re-trigger.
 * Acceptable for single-user dev; a persistent queue is the production fix.
